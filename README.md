# Algo-Practice

This repo is meant to track my progress with algorithms and also keep me honest with my consistency!

The main goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills by focusing on specific algo topics, analyzing and elaborating on different approaches, consistently psudo-coding, solving problems naively && then optimize and analyzing Time/Space Complexities.
